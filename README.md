# Team-Bravo-2023 Django-Rest-Backend

This is the current backend for Picastro, an image sharing mobile application for astrophotographers. This backend is written in Python, using both [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/) and [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to facilitate it's functionalities.


## Requirements

In order to run the backend server on a local machine, Python and its package installer [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) must be installed. Furthermore, you need to be familiar with [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/) and [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

Currently (during development phase), the backend uses a local SQLite Database. SQLite is a built-in software on most computers and does not need any additional installation.

All libraries needed to build this application can be found in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). In order to install them, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
